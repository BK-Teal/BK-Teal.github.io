# Kiwi Farms killed one of our own. Cloudflare is protecting them.

## Kiwi Farms' users stalk, harrass, dox, bully and attack people, ultimately driving them to suicide.


Near (also known as Byuu) were a geek, a coder, a hacker. They were one of us. They wrote the brilliant [bsnes](https://bsnes.dev/) and [higan](https://higan.dev/) emulators. [Here's](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/how-snes-emulators-got-a-few-pixels-from-complete-perfection/) an article by them explaining the level of detail that went into their work. They were a genius. 

They took their life on Jun 27<sup>th</sup> as a direct result of harrassment they faced from Kiwi Farm users. Here's the text of their last ever Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/near_koukai/status/1408940057235312640?s=20):



 > The honest truth is that I have been bullied, ridiculed and humiliated all my life. From my earliest primary school memories to the present. It always hurts me so deeply that I can’t describe it in words. When it was 4chan, I could only endure heavy depression.

 > But Kiwi Farms made the harassment order of magnitude worse. It escalated from attacking my autism to attacking and beating my friend and trying to suicide bait another person, just to get my response. I lost one of my best friends. I feel responsible.

 > I can no longer deal with this matter. I have tried everything. I have taken all available medicines. I tried multiple therapists. I have tried to isolate myself from the world. It didn’t help at all. Every night, I am full of panic attacks, fears and worries.

 > I have tried to make changes in every possible way because they want me to do so in order to stop this situation, but it never will. Every few months, there will be something new. A new dox, a new thread, a new tangent. Can’t bear too much.

 > I have always tried my best to be kind and helpful to everyone. Apart from being weird online, I did nothing wrong. Sometimes it may be a little too enthusiastic. Their horrible claims are completely unfounded. However, if I hurt anyone or make anyone feel uneasy, I’m really sorry.

 > The Internet is not a game. This is real life. I am a real person. This thing really hurts. I have devoted my entire life to this. I have no friends in real life, and I have no other reason to exist. only this. And now I have nothing.

 > It’s too late for me, but I pray that someone will do something for the site at some point. There are too many people suffering, and no one seems to care, because we are relatively unknown on the Internet and they know this. Evil triumphs when good people do nothing.

 > Please don’t remember me because of this. Remember what I did. For my work and dedication. Thank you very much for your kindness and support over the years. I’m sorry, but know that I love you very much. Hope that something better is waiting.

 > Please don’t hate me for this. As far as I know, this will make some of you suffer, but please understand that my suffering is much more. I believe some people will try to take this as my fault. but it is not the truth. They don’t have to do this, they can stop at any time, but choose not to do so.

 > If Joshua Moon showed only a little sympathy for me, I would move on. But he chose not to. That’s not me, that’s him. This is true for everyone who has pushed me to this point without letting go. I never got these.

 > Thank you very much for your kind comments. please take care of yourself. I love you very much. Thank you for your support over the years. It’s an honor that I will miss you so much, but at least I can finally calm down.



[Kiwi Farms](https://kiwifarms.net) is **one of the worst cesspits** on the internet. It is run by Joshua Conner Moon. Near was targetted because they were non-binary. 

 > Kiwi Farms was spun off from CWCiki, which is a wiki dedicated to Chris-Chan. They are a forum focused on cyberbullying others. They especially tend to pay attention to people in disadvantaged groups. For example, as far as I know, Byuu is considered non-binary, which is why they started harassing him. They seem to be the main catalyst for this situation.

The targets (known as Lolcows) who end up on Kiwi Farms are digitally stalked, harassed (by having rumors and smears posted about them) and doxed (including full names, birthdays, workplaces, personal social media accounts, and even street addresses and phone numbers). At least four people have committed suicide after being featured on Kiwi Farms. They are then mocked by the forum users.


# Kiwi Farms killed Near. They're not the only one.


In 2018 transgender game developer Chloe Sagal [was driven](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/chloe-sagal-suicide-cyberbullying-harassment/) to suicide by the forum.
 
There are more victims: see [this](https://samambreen.wordpress.com/tag/julie-terryberry/) and [this](https://gizmodo.com/the-worst-site-on-the-web-gets-ddosd-after-being-connec-1847196197).  
[Here](https://archive.is/NExCg) is the "lolcow wiki" page discussing Julie Terryberry, one of their victims. Look at the language they use.  
There's a lot more examples of their bullying on [this](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Kiwi_Farms) RationalWiki page, along with sources.

**[Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12pOhaaFh998B0kyc5Sm4IhlhIp1c9t5gDNTVVPaiJgI/) a heartbraking account of what happened  to Near from their friend.**

# Cloudflare provides protection to Kiwi Farms. 

In 2019 Cloudflare terminated service for 8chan by saying [this](https://blog.cloudflare.com/terminating-service-for-8chan/):

 > [...] we draw the line at platforms that have demonstrated they directly inspire tragic events and are lawless by design
 
 This is the same. Kiwi Farms is murdering people. Cloudflare, stop providing them your services.
