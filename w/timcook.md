# What Happened, Tim Cook?

In 2014, Tim Cook [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up):

 > The company I am so fortunate to lead has long advocated for human rights and equality for all. 
 
In 2020, Apple:

1. Removed an app that let pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong track authoritarian police ([article](https://www.npr.org/2019/10/10/768841864/after-china-objects-apple-removes-app-used-by-hong-kong-protesters)).
  
   > Apple has removed from its App Store a smartphone app used by Hong Kong pro-democracy activists to crowdsource the location of protesters and police.
   
2. Forced [Telegram](https://telegram.org) to remove channels that Belarusian protestors used to identify members of their authoritarian regime ([article](https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/apple-telegram-belarus/)).
   
   > Apple is requesting that Telegram shut down three channels used in Belarus to expose the identities of individuals belonging to the Belarusian authoritarian regime that may be oppressing civilians. 
   
   Apple then [prevented Telegram from telling users why they couldn't access these messages](https://t.me/durov/136):
   
   > Previously, when removing posts at Apple’s request, Telegram replaced those posts with a notice that cited the exact rule limiting such content for iOS users. However, Apple reached out to us a while ago and said our app is not allowed to show users such notices because they were _“irrelevant”_.
   
 So much for human rights and equality for all.
